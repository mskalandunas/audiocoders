        <p>I fully believe that if you don’t give yourself challenges, you tend not to grow.</p>
        <p>If you’re not growing, eventually I think you’d find it difficult to be living well too.</p>
        <p>So, in addition to starting a new job last month, I decided to give myself another personal challenge – learn how to use the text editor Vim.</p>
        <p>I’m generally slightly obsessed with smoothness and efficiency. If I can do something easier, faster, or in less steps, then I’ll pursue that new way of doing things. Most of the time, this requires that I confront a large learning curve up from to get an even larger ROI on the back end.</p>
        <p>Most of the time, all of this work is totally worth it. In the case of Vim, it very much is.</p>
        <h2>What is Vim?</h2>
        <p>If you’ve never heard of Vim before, you can check it out here.</p>
        <p>In short, it is a considerably old “modal” text editor that rewards heavy reliance on the keyboard and efficient commands.</p>
        <p>When using Vim you can’t just start typing as you do in any other text editor – you have to jump into “insert mode” (much like Pro Tools’ mode system).</p>
        <p>Instead of using the mouse to scroll up and down a file, you can do so with the “j” and “k” keys on your keyboard. You can also use shortcuts to jump to a specific line, the top, middle, or bottom of a file, and anywhere you’ve bookmarked.</p>
        <p>You can also edit, add, or remove multiple lines of text with a few simple key commands.</p>
        <p>It’s also extremely extendable via custom scripting.</p>
        <p>All of these neat tools, combined with the encouragement Vim gives you to never take your hands off of the keyboard, means that you can get really fast and accurate if you take the time to learn its system.</p>
        <p>For extra eye candy, here’s a few shots of crazy advanced things you can do:</p>
